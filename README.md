# Comparison Of Algorithms



## Description

This project aims to compare the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort algorithms in different data sizes ranging from 10,000 to 1,00,000 inputs. The project will then compare the counts of statements executed in each algorithm within the respected input size.

## Dataset

The data set utilized in this project are random generated integers that adheres to the input sizes required to be processed. For the best-case analysis, the generated integers are sorted already. For the worst-case analysis, the generated data set is arranged in descending order. For the average-case analysis, the dataset is generated and arranged randomly.
