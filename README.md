# Comparison Of Algorithms



## Description

This project aims to compare the Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, and Selection Sort algorithms in different data sizes ranging from 10,000 to 1,00,000 inputs. The project will then compare the counts of statements executed in each algorithm within the respected input size.

## Dataset

The study draws upon a dataset comprising 1,000,000 company names sourced from [source]. To facilitate a comprehensive analysis of algorithmic performance, the dataset was subjected to sorting in various orders: random, ascending, and descending. These distinct orders allowed for the examination of average-case, best-case, and worst-case scenarios for each algorithm under analysis.
